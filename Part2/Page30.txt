    SUPPORTED The permission is fully supported in custom roles.
    TESTING The permission is being tested to check its compatibility with custom roles. You can include the permission in custom roles, but you might see unexpected behavior. Not recommended for production use.
    NOT_SUPPORTED The permission is not supported in custom roles.
    You can't use TESTING as it is not good for prod. And you need first version which should be ALPHA. Answer should be A.
