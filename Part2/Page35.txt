Question #139

The core business of your company is to rent out construction equipment at large scale. All the equipment that is being rented out has been equipped with multiple sensors that send event information every few seconds. These signals can vary from engine status, distance traveled, fuel level, and more. Customers are billed based on the consumption monitored by these sensors. You expect high throughput `" up to thousands of events per hour per device `" and need to retrieve consistent data based on the time of the event. Storing and retrieving individual signals should be atomic. What should you do?

A. Create a file in Cloud Storage per device and append new data to that file.
B. Create a file in Cloud Filestore per device and append new data to that file.
C. Ingest the data into Datastore. Store data in an entity group based on the device.
D. Ingest the data into Cloud Bigtable. Create a row key based on the event timestamp.
Correct Answer: 
    D üó≥Ô∏è
    => Information every few seconds --> Time Series --> Big Table 
    => Timeseries + IoT = Bigtable

You are asked to set up application performance monitoring on Google Cloud projects A, B, and C as a single pane of glass. You want to monitor CPU, memory, and disk. What should you do?

A. Enable API and then share charts from project A, B, and C.
B. Enable API and then give the metrics.reader role to projects A, B, and C.
C. Enable API and then use default dashboards to view all projects in sequence.
D. Enable API, create a workspace under project A, and then add projects B and C.

Correct Answer: 
    C üó≥Ô∏è
    Keep Project A as host project in workspace and Project B and C as Service Project, and monitor the metrics of the Project A for a centralized view.
    
    
    Group dashboards are limited to 40 charts. Charts on a group dashboard display data only from the members of the group.
