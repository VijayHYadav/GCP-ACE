    A - allows to view metadata, but won't allow to run queries
        When applied to a dataset, this role provides the ability to read the dataset's metadata and list tables in the dataset.

        When applied to a project, this role also provides the ability to run jobs, including queries, within the project. A principal with this role can enumerate their own jobs, cancel their own jobs, and enumerate datasets within a project. Additionally, allows the creation of new datasets within the project; the creator is granted the BigQuery Data Owner role (roles/bigquery.dataOwner) on these new datasets.

    B - allows to run queries, but also to delete
    C - doesn't follow GCP best practices since Google recommends assigning roles to groups, and groups to users
    D - correct combination of permissions and Google's best practices
