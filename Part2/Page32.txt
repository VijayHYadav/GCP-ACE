Question #125 Explore

Your company publishes large files on an Apache web server that runs on a Compute Engine instance. The Apache web server is not the only application running in the project. You want to receive an email when the egress network costs for the server exceed 100 dollars for the current month as measured by Google Cloud.
What should you do?

A. Set up a budget alert on the project with an amount of 100 dollars, a threshold of 100%, and notification type of ◊í‚Ç¨email.◊í‚Ç¨
B. Set up a budget alert on the billing account with an amount of 100 dollars, a threshold of 100%, and notification type of ◊í‚Ç¨email.◊í‚Ç¨
C. Export the billing data to BigQuery. Create a Cloud Function that uses BigQuery to sum the egress network costs of the exported billing data for the Apache web server for the current month and sends an email if it is over 100 dollars. Schedule the Cloud Function using Cloud Scheduler to run hourly.
D. Use the Cloud Logging Agent to export the Apache web server logs to Cloud Logging. Create a Cloud Function that uses BigQuery to parse the HTTP response log data in Cloud Logging for the current month and sends an email if the size of all HTTP responses, multiplied by current Google Cloud egress prices, totals over 100 dollars. Schedule the Cloud Function using Cloud Scheduler to run hourly.
