An application generates daily reports in a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM). The VM is in the project corp-iot-insights. Your team operates only in the project corp-aggregate-reports and needs a copy of the daily exports in the bucket corp-aggregate-reports-storage. You want to configure access so that the daily reports from the VM are available in the bucket corp-aggregate-reports-storage and use as few steps as possible while following Google-recommended practices. What should you do?

A. Move both projects under the same folder.
B. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-aggregate-reports-storage.
C. Create a Shared VPC network between both projects. Grant the VM Service Account the role Storage Object Creator on corp-iot-insights.
D. Make corp-aggregate-reports-storage public and create a folder with a pseudo-randomized suffix name. Share the folder with the IoT team.

You want to migrate this application to a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) and set up authentication using Google- recommended practices and minimal changes. What should you do?

A. Assign appropriate access for Google services to the service account used by the Compute Engine VM.
B. Create a service account with appropriate access for Google services, and configure the application to use this account.
C. Store credentials for service accounts with appropriate access for Google services in a config file, and deploy this config file with your application.
D. Store credentials for your user account with appropriate access for Google services in a config file, and deploy this config file with your application.

    When you use a GCP service within your app (code), you have to use its client libraries. When you instantiate a client with client libraries you can pass it a Service Account key, which will define on behalf of which SA the client will be acting. That's how you can configure your app to use a particular service account.
    
    DO NOT modify (default) Service account of the VM! big no no. Not recommended by google.
