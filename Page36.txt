Question #142

Your company has workloads running on Compute Engine and on-premises. The Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is connected to your WAN over a

    B - this allows internal communicaiton, but does nothing to limit public traffic
    C - deny all is nice, but it's for egress -- we're looking for ingress
    D - this is way to invasive and doesn't explicitly address the issue of preventing public internet traffic from reaching your instance -- if it does, someone let me know how.
