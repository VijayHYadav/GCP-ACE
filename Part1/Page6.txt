    Correct is A.

    Option B is wrong as the option to use gcloud app cp does not exist.
    Option C is wrong as Deployment Manager does not copy the application, but allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml
    Option D is wrong as gcloud app deploy would not create a new project. The project should be created before usage.
