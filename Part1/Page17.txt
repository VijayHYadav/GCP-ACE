    'A' looks better. 'B' cannot be done. 'C' and 'D' can be done, but migration takes time, also once you delink a billing account to link to new one will derail live projects. A is best choice here.

Question #68

For analysis purposes, you need to send all the logs from all of your Compute Engine instances to a BigQuery dataset called platform-logs. You have already installed the Cloud Logging agent on all the instances. You want to minimize cost. What should you do?


A. 1. Give the BigQuery Data Editor role on the platform-logs dataset to the service accounts used by your instances. 2. Update your instances' metadata to add the following value: logs-destination: bq://platform-logs.
B. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a logs export with a Cloud Pub/Sub topic called logs as a sink. 2. Create a Cloud Function that is triggered by messages in the logs topic. 3. Configure that Cloud Function to drop logs that are not from Compute Engine and to insert Compute Engine logs in the platform-logs dataset.
C. 1. In Cloud Logging, create a filter to view only Compute Engine logs. 2. Click Create Export. 3. Choose BigQuery as Sink Service, and the platform-logs dataset as Sink Destination.
D. 1. Create a Cloud Function that has the BigQuery User role on the platform-logs dataset. 2. Configure this Cloud Function to create a BigQuery Job that executes this query: INSERT INTO dataset.platform-logs (timestamp, log) SELECT timestamp, log FROM compute.logs WHERE timestamp > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) 3. Use Cloud Scheduler to trigger this Cloud Function once a day.
