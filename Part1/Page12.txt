    A üó≥Ô∏è

    Why C is incorrect App Engine Does not use deployment manager
    Both A and D seem correct.
    Lots of people mentioned that app.yaml does not contain project id. That is an incorrect statement. Project is contained in app.YAML for "Standard" app engine application but gcloud config list is has to be used for "FLEXIBLE" application. Since the questions does not inform us whether it is a standard or flexible app, Option D is correct.
