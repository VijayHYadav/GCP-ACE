Question #74 

You need to produce a list of the enabled Google Cloud Platform APIs for a GCP project using the gcloud command line in the Cloud Shell. The project name is my-project. What should you do?

A. Set metadata to enable-oslogin=true for the instance. Grant the dev1 group the compute.osLogin role. Direct them to use the Cloud Shell to ssh to that instance.
B. Set metadata to enable-oslogin=true for the instance. Set the service account to no service account for that instance. Direct them to use the Cloud Shell to ssh to that instance.
C. Enable block project wide keys for the instance. Generate an SSH key for each user in the dev1 group. Distribute the keys to dev1 users and direct them to use their third-party tools to connect.
D. Enable block project wide keys for the instance. Generate an SSH key and associate the key with that instance. Distribute the key to dev1 users and direct them to use their third-party tools to connect.

    "Set metadata to enable-oslogin=true for the instance." This means the metadata for oslogin has been set to that particular instance only, and not for all

Correct Answer: 
    D üó≥Ô∏è
    A. ....'Google Kubernetes Engine'.... - No need to involve GKE. Not the right option
    B. ....'Compute Engine instance'.... - No need to involve Compute Engine.
    C. ....'Separate app in App Engine'....- No need to deploy as a separate app. versioning is supported already. Not the right option.
    D. This is the right answer.
