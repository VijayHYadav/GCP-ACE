Shared VPC => Your organization has multiple projects. You want
resources in different projects to talk to each other.

# Hybrid Cloud
    # Cloud VPN
        Connect on-premises network to the GCP network
    # Cloud Interconnect
        High speed physical connection between on-premises and VPC networks

# VPC Network Peering

ClusterIP : A virtual private internal IP address is allocated to service. This IP can be used
only within the cluster. Pods and nodes in cluster can acces this IP address. If we are not
going to specify service type during object creation time, default ClusterIP is chosen. The
external clients can not access the service IP.

NodePort : A port is dynamically allocated from port range 30000-32768 to each node of the
cluster and any one can access these nodeip:nodeport combinations. NodePort itself behind
the scene uses ClusterIP to send te traffic to pods. When we send the request to 
nodeip:nodeport, it is forwarded to clusterip:serviceport and finally forwarded to 
podid:targetport. the problem with nodeport is that if there are 3 nodes in cluster we may
have to use 3 combinatins of nodeip:nodeport, which is agian difficult.

LoadBalancer: By default, no load balancer is available internally in Kubernetes. We have to use
external Load balancer (LB) from cloud providers such as AWS, GCP or Azure. LB behind the scene
create NodePort Service and just load balance the traffic to nodeip:nodeport combinations.

# Autohealing    
Autohealing lets you automatically restart apps that are compromised. It promptly detects failed 
instances and recreates them automatically,

# Load balancing
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend 
servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

# Autoscaling 
Autoscaling, also spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling, and sometimes also called automatic scaling, 
is a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a 
server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the 
farm

# Point-in-time
point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides protection against accidental deletion or writes.
The binary log contains “events” that describe database changes such as table creation operations or 
changes to table data. It also contains events for statements that potentially could have made changes 
(for example, a DELETE which matched no rows), unless row-based logging is used. The binary log also 
contains information about how long each statement took that updated data.

# Payment methods : 
Payment methods you can add to your payments profile(credit card, debit card, or bank account).

maxSurge:maxSurge is the maximum number of new pods that will be created at a time 
maxUnavailable: maxUnavailable is the maximum number of old pods that will be deleted at a time.

# Deployment Manager: Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure management service that makes
it simple to create, deploy, and manage Google Cloud Platform resources. (configuration file)

# Cloud Composer: Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service, enabling you to 
create, schedule, monitor, and manage workflows that span across clouds and on-premises data centers.

# Instance template
An instance template is a resource that you can use to create virtual machine (VM) instances and managed 
instance groups (MIGs). Instance templates define the machine type, boot disk image or container image, 
labels, startup script, and other instance properties.

# Managed Instance Group:  A managed instance group (MIG) is a group of virtual machine (VM) instances that
you treat as a single entity. Each VM in a MIG is based on an instance template. If you only need to 
create multiple VMs, but don't want them grouped together in a MIG, see the bulk instance API.

# Unmanaged Instance Group: An unmanaged instance group is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that 
reside in a single zone, VPC network, and subnet. An unmanaged instance group is useful for grouping
together VMs that require individual configuration settings or tuning.

# BigQuery: 
Export your bill to a BigQuery datase

# Network Tag : Network tags are metadata on compute engine virtual machines that allow you to make 
firewall rules and routes applicable to specific VM instances. In GKE, you can use network tags to make 
firewall rules or routes applicable to the node in your cluster.

# SSL 
SSL Proxy Load Balancing is intended for non-HTTP(S) traffic. 
For HTTP(S) traffic, we recommend that you use HTTP(S) Load Balancing.

SSL Proxy Load Balancing can be configured as a global load balancing service.

Network load balancer is Regional


# Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy for SSH and TCP : 
IAP TCP to enable access to VM instances that do not have external IP addresses 
or do not permit direct access over the internet.
